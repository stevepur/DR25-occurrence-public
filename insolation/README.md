# DR25-occurrence-public/insolation
This repository contains the code used to compute the results reported in "The Occurrence of Rocky Habitable Zone Planets Around Solar-Like Stars from Kepler Data" (to appear in The Astronomical Journal), https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14812, which computes occurrence rates using the flux incidenct on exoplanets, carefully selecting parameters optimal for habitability.  Unlike the previous two papers, we have confidence in the accuracy of the occurrence rates presented in this paper. 

The Approximate Bayesian Computation code supporting this paper is not included in this repository.

The completeness contours required by this code are too large for GitHub, and are found at http://stevepur.com/completenessContours/.

The code in this repository is not intended to be used by the community, and is neither maintained nor supported.  It is research code that is not intended to be user-friendly.  It is presented so the community can examine how we got the results in the above papers.
