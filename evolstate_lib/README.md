# evolstate

Simple Python script that assigns crude evolutionary states (main-sequence, subgiant, red giant) to stars given an input temperature and radius/surface gravity, based on physically motivated boundaries from *solar metallicity* interior models. Details are described in [Huber et al. 2017](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...844..102H) and [Berger et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00231).

See notebook for usage.
