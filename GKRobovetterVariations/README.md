This repository contains the code used to compute the results reported in "Reliability Correction is Key for Robust Kepler Occurrence Rates" https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abb316, https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15719, which demonstrates the occurrence rates are robustly independent of catalog variations when correcting for reliability, and depend on catalog variations when not correcting for reliability.  

The Approximate Bayesian Computation code supporting this paper is not included in this repository.

The code in this repository is not intended to be used by the community, and is neither maintained nor supported.  It is research code that is not intended to be user-friendly.  It is presented so the community can examine how we got the results in the above papers.
